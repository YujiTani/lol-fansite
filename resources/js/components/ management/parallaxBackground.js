                Only 10 Champions have yet to be picked in a competitive League in 2020, all 138 other champions have already been picked!
            </h2>

            <p>
                I was bored and looking through stats and stuff and realized that as of February, only the following Champions have yet to be picked this year:
                
                Udyr, Teemo, Rammus, Vi, Wukong, Brand, Amumu, Volibear, Janna, Neeko
                
                This list includes all of the European ERLs, every Worlds Qualifying competitive league and their 2nd division/academy leagues, most Latin American regional leagues (I think?)!

                PS: Also a fun stat, Master Yi hasn't gotten a single competitive win since July 2018, AKA the funnel days (damn I didn't realize it's almost been 2 years already)

                This article is about the slang term. For an online game also known as "LOL", see League of Legends.
                "LMFAO" redirects here. For the music group, see LMFAO (group).
                LOL is an internet slang term that means "laugh out loud". It is commonly mistaken for "lots of love." LOL is often used in messages meaning "That is really funny."

                It also means mute in Persian and is a native Dutch word (not an acronym) which means "fun" ("lollig" means "funny"). In Welsh, lol means nonsense - e.g., if a person wanted to say "utter nonsense" in Welsh, they would say "rwtsh lol".[1] LOL is usually used on the internet or when text messaging.[2]
